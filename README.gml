          SONIC is copyright SEGA, you know the drill. 

Disclaimer:
           
Although the basic concept for collisions/positioning is the same as in many others, this entire system was created from scratch 
and has various differences in the physics/organization. Also a few nifty features : )
I've tried to comment things out as best I could. If you go to p_main() you'll find the player's main code(which references
other code scripts accordingly).

Just hoping to help people further understand to use it for their own, or just to have a leg
up on a project they really would like to start. If you do happen to throw this into
your game, it would probably be a good idea to try to understand enough so that things work
in the long run.

If you use this engine base or find it useful in your projects, please give due credit(I mean it's based on something by the geniuses at 
SEGA, but it was just a few hundred hours of my time spent recreating it. lol). Also, if you are using it in your project I 
would love to hear about it. My email address is roco0086@gmail.com.

                        Thanks for reading!
